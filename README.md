# FEniCS_homogenization
A collection of homogenization scripts for linear elasticity. See https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for more details


# Some sample cases
The above code `3dtest.py` runs elementary load cases (6 of them in 3D) to numerically determine the effective modulus (6 x 6 tensor). See for instance, below, a "simple cubic" unit cell with a spherical void placed at the geometric center of the cube. The corresponding displacement ($u$) is rendered below.
