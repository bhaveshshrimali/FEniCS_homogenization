# FEniCS_homogenization
A collection of homogenization scripts for linear elasticity. See https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for more details


# Some sample cases
Added are some elementary load cases for a "simple cubic" unit cell with a spherical void placed at the geometric center of the cube.
